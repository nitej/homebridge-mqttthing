   * [Supported Accessories](#supported-accessories)
   * [Release notes](#release-notes)

# Installation
Follow the instructions in [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for the homebridge server installation.
This plugin is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-mqttthing) and should be installed "globally" by typing:

    npm install -g homebridge-mqttthing

# Configuration
Configure the plugin in your homebridge config.json file.

Note that setXxx topics are published by Homebridge and should be subscribed-to by devices, and getXxx topics are published by devices to provide feedback on state to Homebridge.

Various different service types are supported by this single 'mqttthing' accessory...

**All values shown below (often within <>) are comments/descriptions, and should not be copied into your configuration file. For an example of an actual configuration file, please see `test/config.json`.**

    "startPub": {
        "topic1": "message1",
        "topic2": "message2"
    },
    "confirmationPeriodms": 1000,
    "retryLimit": 5
}
```

### General Settings

`accessory` - must always be set to the value `mqttthing` in order to use **homebridge-mqttthing**

`type` - one of the supported accessory types listed below

`name` - name of accessory, as displayed in HomeKit

`caption` - HomeKit caption/label (optional)

### MQTT Settings

`url` - URL of MQTT server if not localhost port 1883 (optional)

`username` - Username for MQTT server (optional)

`password` - Password for MQTT server (optional)

`mqttOptions` - Object containing all MQTT options passed to https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt#client, for MQTT configuration settings not supported above (optional). Any standard settings *not* specified in an **mqttOptions** option will be set by homebridge-mqttthing. Enable MQTT logging with **logMqtt** to check the options provided.
 
`mqttPubOptions` - Option containing any MQTT publishing options required. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt#publish for details.

`logMqtt` - Set to true to enable MQTT logging for this accessory (optional, defaults to false)

### MQTT Topics

`getName` - Topic that may be published to send HomeKit the name of the accessory (optional)

`getOnline` - Topic that may be published to tell homebridge-mqttthing whether or not the accessory is online (optional). This is a Boolean value (see below) intended to be published as false by the MQTT Last Will and Testament (LWT) feature in order to notify homebridge-mqttthing that the accessory is offline. Accessories using this feature must also publish an online true status when available.

`getBatteryLevel` - Topic that may be published by an accessory to indicate its current battery level, from 0 to 100 (optional).

`getChargingState` - Topic that may be published by an accessory to indicate its charging state (optional). Default values accepted are `[ "NOT_CHARGING", "CHARGING", "NOT_CHARGEABLE" ]`. These may be changed with the `chargingStateValues` setting.

`getStatusLowBattery` - Topic that may be published by an accessory to indicate whether it has a low battery (optional).

### Applying functions to MQTT messages (custom payload encoding/decoding)

If an MQTT message is not a simple value or does not match the expected syntax, it is possible to specify a JavaScript function that is called for the message every time it is received/published. For this, the topic string in the configuration can be replaced with an object with these properties:

`topic` - Topic string

`apply` - Javascript function to apply (must be a complete function body that `return`s a value). The function is called with one argument: `message`, holding the original message. (optional)

e.g. Decoding a JSON payload:
```javascript
  "topics": {
      "getCurrentTemperature": {
          "topic": "outdoor",
          "apply": "return JSON.parse(message).temperature.toFixed(1);"
      }
  }
```

e.g. Scaling brightness from its internal 0-100 range to an external 0-255 range:
```javascript
    "getBrightness": {
        "topic": "test/lightbulb/getBrightness",
        "apply": "return Math.round( message / 2.55 );"
    },
    "setBrightness": {
        "topic": "test/lightbulb/setBrightness",
        "apply": "return Math.round( message * 2.55 );"
    }
```

### Boolean Value Settings

Homekit Boolean types like on/off use strings "true" and "false" in MQTT messages unless `"integerValue": true` is configured, in which case they use to "1" and "0". Alternatively, specific values can be configured using `onValue` and `offValue` (in which case `integerValue` is ignored). Other Homekit types (integer, string, etc.) are not affected by these settings.

`integerValue` - set to **true** to use the values **1** and **0** to represent Boolean values instead of the strings **"true"** and **"false"** (optional, defaults to false)

`onValue` - configure a specific Boolean true or *on* value (optional)

`offValue` - configure a specific Boolean false or *off* value (optional)

When `onValue` and `offValue` are configured, by default any other value received on the _get_ topic will be ignored. To treat unrecognized received values as off, set `otherValueOff: true`.

`onlineValue` - configure a specific value representing that an accessory is online (received through `getOnline`). If not specified, the configured *on* value will be used to represent an online state (i.e. `onValue` if configured, otherwise **1** with `integerValue: true` or **true** with `integerValue: false`).

In mqttthing versions before 1.0.23, receiving any value not matching the configured 'on value' for a Boolean characteristic turned it off. From 1.0.23, the received message must match the offValue to turn off a characteristic.
To turn off on any value except the onValue, omit configuration of offValue.

From version 1.0.23, mqttthing will not publish a message for a Boolean characteristic turning off if no offValue is configured.

### Accessory Information

The following configuration settings may be specified if required to change information service content:

`manufacturer` - sets the manufacturer name (defaults to *mqttthing*)

`serialNumber` - sets the serial number (defaults to hostname and accessory name)

`model` - sets the model name (defaults to the mqttthing accessory type)

`firmwareRevision` - sets the firmware revision number (defaults to mqttthing version)

### Publishing values on start-up

MQTT messages may be published on start-up, e.g. to reset accessories to a known initial state, with `startPub`. This is an object containing MQTT topics as keys, and values to be published as values.

### History Service

For some accessory types you can enable the History Service powered by [fakegato-history](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history). It will show up in the Eve App. (Home.app does not support it).

Depending on the accessory type, fakegato-history may add extra entries every 10 minutes or may average the entries from the plugin and send data every 10 minutes.

History is currently supported for:
* Temperature Sensor
* Humidity Sensor
* Air Pressure Sensor
* Air Quality Sensor
* Motion Sensor
* Contact Sensor
* Outlet (power consumption)

`history` - set to **true** for enabling History Service (Boolean, optional)

Alternatively, you can specify `history` as an object with some properties:

`size` - maximum size of stored data points (optional), default: 4032

`autoTimer` - enable/disable averaging (and repeating) 10min timer (optional), default: true

`autoRepeat` - enable/disable repetition of last value if no data was received in last 10min interval (optional), default: true

`mergeInterval` - set merge interval [minutes] for events, which are very close in time (optional, for motion sensor only, not in combination with autoTimer/autoRepeat), default: 0

Avoid the use of "/" in characteristics of the Information Service (e.g. serial number, manufacturer, etc.), since this may cause data to not appear in the history. Note that if your Eve.app is controlling more than one accessory for each type, the serial number should be unique, otherwise Eve.app will merge the histories.

### Confirmation

Some accessories support confirmation for some of their 'set' topics. When enabled by configuring `confirmationPeriodms`, the accessory *must* echo anything sent to appropriate `setX` subject(s) to the corresponding `getX` subject(s). Where homebridge-mqttthing doesn't see a confirmation within the configured configuration period (specified in milliseconds), it will publish the set message again. Messages will be republished up to 3 times by default, but this can be changed by also specifying `retryLimit`.

Accessories supporting message confirmation list the topics supporting message confirmation below.

    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Air Quality Sensor

Air quality state can be `UNKNOWN`, `EXCELLENT`, `GOOD`, `FAIR`, `INFERIOR` or `POOR`. To use different values, specify them in **airQualityValues** in that order.

For Air Quality History (in the Eve-App) you have to use `getAirQualityPPM`.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "airQualitySensor",
    "name": "<name of device>",
    "serviceNames": {
        "temperature": "<name for temperature service (optional)>",
        "humidity":    "<name for humidity service (optional)>"
    },
    "topics":
    {
        "getAirQuality":              "<topic used to report air quality",
        "getCarbonDioxideLevel":      "<topic used to report carbon dioxide level (optional)>",
        "getPM10Density":             "<topic used to report PM10 Density (optional)>",
        "getPM2_5Density":            "<topic used to report PM2.5 Density (optional)>",
        "getOzoneDensity":            "<topic used to report Ozone Density (optional)>",

    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Carbon Dioxide Sensor

Carbon dioxide detected state can be `NORMAL` or `ABNORMAL`. To use different values, specify them in **carbonDioxideDetectedValues** in that order.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "carbonDioxideSensor",
    "name": "<name of device>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getCarbonDioxideDetected":     "<topic used to report carbon dioxide detected",
        "getCarbonDioxideLevel":        "<topic used to report carbon dioxide level (optional)>",
        "getCarbonDioxidePeakLevel":    "<topic used to report carbon dioxide level (optional)>",
        "getStatusActive":              "<topic used to provide 'active' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusFault":               "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":            "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":          "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "carbonDioxideDetectedValues": [ "normal-value", "abnormal-value" ]
}
```


## Contact Sensor

Contact sensor state is exposed as a Boolean. True (or 1 with integer values) maps to `CONTACT_NOT_DETECTED` (sensor triggered)
and False (or 0) maps to `CONTACT_DETECTED` (not triggered). To use different MQTT values, configure `onValue` and `offValue`.

If `history` is enabled, this plugin will count the number of openings and offers the possibility to reset the counter from the Eve app.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "contactSensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getContactSensorState": "<topic used to provide 'contact sensor' state>",
        "getStatusActive":       "<topic used to provide 'active' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusFault":        "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":     "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":   "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "integerValue": "true to use 1|0 instead of true|false default onValue and offValue",
    "onValue": "<value representing on (optional)>",
    "offValue": "<value representing off (optional)>",
    "resetStateAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to reset state automatically (optional)>",
    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Doorbell

Doorbell ring switch state can be be `SINGLE_PRESS`, `DOUBLE_PRESS` or `LONG_PRESS`. By default, these events are raised when values of `1`, `2` and `L` respectively are published to the **getSwitch** topic. However, these values may be overridden by specifying an alternative array in the **switchValues** setting.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "doorbell",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getSwitch":         "<topic used to provide doorbell switch state>"
        "getBrightness":     "<topic used to get brightness (optional)>",
        "setBrightness":     "<topic used to set brightness (optional)>",
        "getVolume":         "<topic used to get volume (optional)>",
        "setVolume":         "<topic used to set volume (optional)>",
        "getMotionDetected": "<topic used to provide 'motion detected' status (optional, if exposing motion sensor)>"
    },
    "switchValues": "<array of 3 switch values corresponding to single-press, double-press and long-press respectively (optional)>"
}
```

## Fan

Fan running state ('on') is true or false, or 1 or 0 if `integerValue: true` specified.

Fan rotation direction is 0 for clockwise or 1 for anticlockwise.

Fan rotation speed is an integer between 0 (off) and 100 (full speed).

Set `confirmationPeriodms` to enable publishing confirmation for `setOn`/`getOn`. The accessory must echo messages it receives through the `setOn` subject to the `getOn` subject, otherwise homebridge-mqttthing will mark it as unresponsive and republish on the `setOn` subject.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "fan",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getOn":                "<topic to notify homebridge of 'fan on' status>",
        "setOn":                "<topic published by homebridge to set 'fan on' status>",
        "getRotationDirection": "<topic to notify homebridge of rotation direction (optional)> ",
        "setRotationDirection": "<topic published by homebridge to set rotation direction (optional)>",
        "getRotationSpeed":     "<topic to notify homebridge of rotation speed (optional)",
        "setRotationSpeed":     "<topic published by homebridge to set rotation speed (optional)"
    },
    "integerValue": "true to use 1|0 instead of true|false default onValue and offValue",
    "onValue": "<value representing on (optional)>",
    "offValue": "<value representing off (optional)>",
    "turnOffAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to turn off automatically (optional)>"
}
```

## Garage Door Opener

Garage door opener current door state can be **OPEN**, **CLOSED**, **OPENING**, **CLOSING**, **STOPPED**. By default, these use values of `O`, `C`, `o`, `c` and `S` respectively; these defaults can be changed using the **doorValues** setting.

Garage door opener target state can be **OPEN** or **CLOSED**. By default, values of `O` and `C` are used respectively (unless changed through **doorValues**).

Lock current state can be **UNSECURED**, **SECURED**, **JAMMED** or **UNKNOWN**. By default, these use values of `U`, `S`, `J`, `?` respectively; these can be changed using the **lockValues** setting.

Lock target state can be **UNSECURED** or **SECURED**. By default, these use values of `U` and `S` respectively (unless changed through **lockValues**).

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "garageDoorOpener",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "setTargetDoorState":       "test/garage/target",
        "getTargetDoorState":       "test/garage/current",
        "getCurrentDoorState":      "test/garage/current",
        "setLockTargetState":       "test/garagelock/target",

    },
    "doorValues": [ "Open", "Closed", "Opening", "Closing", "Stopped" ],
    "lockValues": [ "Unsecured", "Secured", "Jammed",  "Unknown" ]
}
```

### Topics

`setTargetDoorState` - Topic published when the target door state is changed in HomeKit. Values are _final_ `doorValues` (not opening/closing).

`getTargetDoorState` - Topic that may be published to notify HomeKit that the target door state has been changed externally. Values are _final_ `doorValues` (not opening/closing). May use same topic as `getCurrentDoorState` as above. Omit if all control is through HomeKit.

`getCurrentDoorState` - Topic published to notify HomeKit that a door state has been achieved. HomeKit will expect current door state to end up matching target door state. Values are `doorValues`.

`setLockTargetState` - Topic published when the target lock state is changed in HomeKit. Values are `lockValues`.

`getLockTargetState` - Topic that may be published to notify HomeKit that the target lock state has been changed externally. Values are `lockValues`. May use same topic as `getLockCurrentState` as above. Omit if all control is through HomeKit.

`getLockCurrentState` - Topic published to notify HomeKit that a lock state has been achieved. Values are `lockValues`.

`getObstructionDetected` - Topic published to notify HomeKit whether an obstruction has been detected (Boolean value).

### Values

`doorValues` - Array of 5 door values corresponding to open, closed, opening, closing and stopped respectively. If not specified, defaults to `[ 'O', 'C', 'o', 'c', 'S' ]`.

`lockValues` - Array of 4 lock values corresponding to unsecured, secured, jammed and unknown respectively. if not specified, defaults to `[ 'U', 'S', 'J', '?' ]`.

`integerValue` - Set to true to use values 1 and 0 instead of "true" and "false" respectively for obstruction detected value.


## Heater Cooler

Current heater/cooler state can be **INACTIVE**, **IDLE**, **HEATING** or **COOLING**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in **currentHeaterCoolerValues**.

Target heater/cooler state can be **AUTO**, **HEAT** or **COOL**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in **targetHeaterCoolerValues**.

Lock physical controls state may be **DISABLED** or **ENABLED**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in **lockPhysicalControlsValues**.

Swing mode state may be **DISABLED** or **ENABLED**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in **swingModeValues**.

Temperature display units can be **CELSIUS** or **FAHRENHEIT**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in `temperatureDisplayUnitsValues`.

`minTemperature` and `maxTemperature` may optionally be used to change the minimum and maximum heating and cooling target temperatures that can be set from Homekit.

Configure `restrictHeaterCoolerState` to an array of integers to restrict the target heating/cooling states made available by Homekit, where 0 represents AUTO, 1 HEAT and 2 COOL, for example:

   * `"restrictHeaterCoolerState": [0, 1]` - for AUTO or HEAT (but no COOL).
   * `"restrictHeaterCoolerState": [1, 2]` - for HEAT or COOL (but no AUTO).

Configure cooling threshold temperature unless target heater/cooler states exclude **COOL**, and/or heating threshold temperature unless target heater/cooler states exclude **HEAT**.

}
```


## Humidity Sensor

Current relative humidity must be in the range 0 to 100 percent with no decimal places.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "humiditySensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getCurrentRelativeHumidity":   "<topic used to provide 'current relative humidity'>",
        "getStatusActive":              "<topic used to provide 'active' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusFault":               "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":            "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":          "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Leak Sensor

Leak sensor state is exposed as a Boolean. True (or 1 with integer values) maps to `LEAK_DETECTED` 
and False (or 0) maps to `LEAK_NOT_DETECTED`. To use different MQTT values, configure `onValue` and `offValue`.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "leakSensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getLeakDetected":              "<topic used to provide 'leak detected' state (Boolean)>",
    },
    "resetStateAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to reset state automatically (optional)>"
}
```


## Light bulb

Light bulb can either use separate topics (for on, brightness, hue and saturation), or it can be configured to use a combined value holding comma-separated hue,sat,val or red,green,blue. 

Hue is 0-360. Saturation is 0-100. Brightness is 0-100. Red, green and blue are 0-255.

If `topics.setHSV` is populated, a combined value is used and any individual brightness, hue and saturation topics are ignored. On/off is sent with `setOn` if configured, or by setting V to 0 when off.

If `topics.setRGB` is populated, a combined value is used in the format red,green,blue (ranging from 0-255). On/off may be sent with `setOn`; brightness, hue and saturation topics are ignored. If `topics.setWhite` is also populated, the white level is extracted and sent separately to the combined RGB value.

Configuring `topics.setWhite` without `topics.setRGB` will give a dimmable white light with a range from 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness) using the `setWhite` topic only (i.e. with no separate on/off state through `setOn`).

If `topics.setRGBW` is populated, a combined value is used in the format red,green,blue,white (ranging from 0-255). The minimum of red, green and blue is subtracted from all three colour channels and sent to the white channel instead. On/off may be set with `setOn` (otherwise "0,0,0,0" indicates off); brightness, hue, saturation and temperature topics are ignored.

If `topics.setRGBWW` is populated, a combined value is used in the format red,green,blue,warm_white,cold_white (each component ranging from 0-255). Warm and cold white components are set based on the colour values published by Homekit from the _Temperature_ control, and after warm and cold white are extracted any remaining white level in the RGB values is sent equally to both white channels. The RGB values used for warm white and cold white extraction can be configured with `warmWhite` and `coldWhite`, allowing calibration to RGBWW LED colours. (Homekit's warm white and cold white colours are used by default.) On/off may be set with `setOn` (otherwise "0,0,0,0,0" indicates off); brightness, hue, saturation and temperature topics are ignored. (Homekit's behaviour when a coloured (hue/saturation-supporting) light also attempts to support temperature can be unpredictable - so the RGBWW implementation does not use Homekit colour temperature.)

Set `confirmationPeriodms` to enable publishing confirmation for `setOn`/`getOn`. The accessory must echo messages it receives through the `setOn` subject to the `getOn` subject, otherwise homebridge-mqttthing will mark it as unresponsive and republish on the `setOn` subject.

## Light Sensor

Current ambient light level must be in the range 0.0001 Lux to 100000 Lux to a maximum of 4dp.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "lightSensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",

```


## Lock Mechanism

Lock current state can be **UNSECURED**, **SECURED**, **JAMMED** or **UNKNOWN**. By default, these use values of `U`, `S`, `J`, `?` respectively; these can be changed using the **lockValues** setting.

Lock target state can be **UNSECURED** or **SECURED**. By default, these use values of `U` and `S` respectively (unless changed through **lockValues**).

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "lockMechanism",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "topics":
    {
        "setLockTargetState":       "test/lock/target",
        "getLockTargetState":       "test/lock/current",
        "getLockCurrentState":      "test/lock/current"
    },
    "lockValues": [ "Unsecured", "Secured", "Jammed",  "Unknown" ]
}
```

### Topics

`setLockTargetState` - Topic published when the target lock state is changed in HomeKit. Values are `lockValues`.

`getLockTargetState` - Topic that may be published to notify HomeKit that the target lock state has been changed externally. Values are `lockValues`. May use same topic as `getLockCurrentState` as above. Omit if all control is through HomeKit.

`getLockCurrentState` - Topic published to notify HomeKit that a lock state has been achieved. Values are `lockValues`.

### Values

`lockValues` - Array of 4 lock values corresponding to unsecured, secured, jammed and unknown respectively. if not specified, defaults to `[ 'U', 'S', 'J', '?' ]`.


## Microphone

        "setVolume":            "<topic used to set volume (0-100)>"
    }
}
```


## Motion Sensor

    "turnOffAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to reset motion sensor state automatically (optional) - allowing a motion sensor just to publish its onValue>",
    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Occupancy Sensor

Occupancy sensor state is exposed as a Boolean. True (or 1 with integer values) maps to `OCCUPANCY_DETECTED` (sensor triggered)
and False (or 0) maps to `OCCUPANCY_NOT_DETECTED` (not triggered). To use different MQTT values, configure `onValue` and `offValue`.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "occupancySensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getOccupancyDetected":      "<topic used to provide 'occupancy detected' status>",
        "getStatusActive":           "<topic used to provide 'active' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusFault":            "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":         "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":       "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "integerValue": "true to use 1|0 instead of true|false default onValue and offValue",
    "onValue": "<value representing on (optional)>",
    "offValue": "<value representing off (optional)>"
}
```


## Outlet

An outlet can be configured as a light or as a fan in the Home app.

If `history` is enabled and no `getTotalConsumption` topic is defined, this plugin will count the total consumption (kWh) by itself and offers the possibility to reset the counter from the Eve app.
The interval of `getWatts` data updates should be less then 10min and at best periodic, in order to avoid averaging errors for the history entries.

Set `confirmationPeriodms` to enable publishing confirmation for `setOn`/`getOn`. The accessory must echo messages it receives through the `setOn` subject to the `getOn` subject, otherwise homebridge-mqttthing will mark it as unresponsive and republish on the `setOn` subject.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "outlet",
    "name": "<name of outlet>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",

    "turnOffAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to turn off automatically (optional)>",
    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Security System

Security System current state can be **STAY_ARM**, **AWAY_ARM**, **NIGHT_ARM**, **DISARMED** or **ALARM_TRIGGERED**. By default, these events are raised when values of `SA`, `AA`, `NA`, `D` and `T` respectively are published to the **getCurrentState** topic. However, these values may be overriden by specifying an alternative array in the **currentStateValues** setting.

Security System target state can be **STAY_ARM**, **AWAY_ARM**, **NIGHT_ARM** or **DISARM**. By default, these states correspond to values of `SA`, `AA`, `NA` and `D`. Homebridge expects to control the target state (causing one of these values to be published to the **setTargetState** topic), and to receive confirmation from the security system that the state has been achieved through a change in the current state (received through the **getCurrentState** topic). The values used for target state can be specified as an an array in the **targetStateValues** setting.

Homebridge publishes a value to the **setTargetState** topic to indicate the state that the HomeKit user wishes the alarm to be in. The alarm system must echo this state back to the **getCurrentState** topic to confirm that it has set the alarm state appropriately. The alarm system may also publish the ALARM_TRIGGERED value (`T` by default) to the **getCurrentState** topic in order to indicate that the alarm has been triggered. While homekit is waiting for the state change to be confirmed, it will display 'Arming...' or 'Disarming...'.

Additionally, the alarm system may change its own target state by publishing to **getTargetState**. As with a homekit-controlled state change, this must be followed by a publish to **getCurrentState** to confirm that the change is complete. It is possible to set **getTargetState** and **getCurrentState** to the same MQTT topic, allowing the alarm system to change the target state and confirm that it has been achieved with a single MQTT message.

Configure `restrictTargetState` to an array of integers to restrict the target states made available by Homekit, where 0 represents STAY_ARM, 1 AWAY_ARM, 2 NIGHT_ARM and 3 DISARM, for example:

   * `"restrictTargetState": [0, 1, 3]` - for STAY_ARM, AWAY_ARM and DISARM (but no NIGHT_ARM)

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "securitySystem",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics": {
        "setTargetState": "test/security/target",
        "getTargetState": "test/security/current",
        "getCurrentState": "test/security/current"
    },
    "targetStateValues": [ "StayArm", "AwayArm", "NightArm", "Disarmed" ],
    "currentStateValues": [ "StayArm", "AwayArm", "NightArm", "Disarmed", "Triggered" ],
    "restrictTargetState": [ 1, 3 ]
}
```

### Topics

`setTargetState` - Topic published when the target alarm state is changed in HomeKit. Values are `targetStateValues`.

`getTargetState` - Topic that may be published to notify HomeKit that the target alarm state has been changed externally. Values are `targetStateValues`. May use same topic as `getCurrentState` as above. Omit if all control is through HomeKit.

`getCurrentState` - Topic published to notify HomeKit that an alarm state has been achieved. HomeKit will expect current state to end up matching target state. Values are `currentStateValues`.

### Values

`targetStateValues` - Array of 4 values for target state corresponding to **STAY_ARM**, **AWAY_ARM**, **NIGHT_ARM** and **DISARMED** respectively. If not specified, defaults to `[ 'SA', 'AA', 'NA', 'D' ]`.

`currentStateValues` - Array of 5 values for current state corresponding to **STAY_ARM**, **AWAY_ARM**, **NIGHT_ARM**, **DISARMED** and **ALARM_TRIGGERED** respectively. If not specified, defaults to `[ 'SA', 'AA', 'NA', 'D', 'T' ]`.


## Smoke Sensor

Smoke sensor state is exposed as a Boolean. True (or 1 with integer values) maps to `SMOKE_DETECTED` 
and False (or 0) maps to `SMOKE_NOT_DETECTED`. To use different MQTT values, configure `onValue` and `offValue`.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "smokeSensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",

        "getStatusFault":        "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":     "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":   "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "integerValue": "true to use 1|0 instead of true|false default onValue and offValue",
    "onValue": "<value representing on (optional)>",
    "offValue": "<value representing off (optional)>",
    "resetStateAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to reset state automatically (optional)>"
}
```


## Speaker

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "speaker",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getMute":              "<topic used to indicate whether speaker is muted (Boolean)>",
        "setMute":              "<topic used to set whether speaker is muted (Boolean)>",
        "getVolume":            "<topic used to report current volume (0-100)>",
        "setVolume":            "<topic used to set volume (0-100)>"
    }
}
```


## StatelessProgrammableSwitch

Like a doorbell (which is based on it), the state of a stateless programmable switch can be be `SINGLE_PRESS`, `DOUBLE_PRESS` or `LONG_PRESS`. By default, these events are raised when values of `1`, `2` and `L` respectively are published to the **getSwitch** topic. However, these values may be overridden by specifying an alternative array in the **switchValues** setting.

The states can be restricted to a subset of these three values available in HomeKit by the **restrictSwitchValues** setting, where 0 represents `SINGLE_PRESS`, 1 `DOUBLE_PRESS`, and 2 `LONG_PRESS`, for example:

   * `"restrictSwitchValues": [0, 2]` - for `SINGLE_PRESS` and `LONG_PRESS`, (but no `DOUBLE_PRESS`)

Additionally, multiple buttons (each potentially with a single, double, and long press action) may be added to a single statelessProgrammableSwitch. This is accomplished by setting the **getSwitch** topic to an array of topics. The number of elements in this array equals the number of buttons on the switch. For example:

* `"getSwitch": ["<button topic 1>", "<button topic 2>", "<button topic 3>"]` - for a 3 button switch

The **switchValues** and **restrictSwitchValues** options also support an array of values such that each switch may different switch values and different allowed button press sequences. A single array of values (like that used for a single) will result in that value being applied to all buttons.

## Switch

On/off switch.

Configuring `turnOffAfter` causes the switch to turn off automatically the specified number of milliseconds after it is turned on by homekit.

Configuring `resetStateAfterms` causes the switch state as reported through the `getOn` topic to be reset to off after the specified number of milliseconds. Use when there is no `setOn` topic.

Set `confirmationPeriodms` to enable publishing confirmation for `setOn`/`getOn`. The accessory must echo messages it receives through the `setOn` subject to the `getOn` subject, otherwise homebridge-mqttthing will mark it as unresponsive and republish on the `setOn` subject.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "switch",
    "name": "<name of switch>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",

    "turnOffAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to turn off automatically (optional)>",
    "resetStateAfterms": "<milliseconds after which to reset state automatically (optional)>"
}
```


## Television

Different input sources (Live TV, HDMI1, HDMI2, ...) can be defined within the array `inputs` (optional). If this is not used, `setActiveInput` and `getActiveInput` have no effect.

To send remote key commands (`setRemoteKey`), you can use the remote control within the (iOS) control center.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "television",
    "name": "<name of TV>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "setActive":            "<topic to set the status>",
        "getActive":            "<topic to get the status>",
        "setActiveInput":       "<topic to set the active input source (optional)>",
        "getActiveInput":       "<topic to get the active input source (optional)>",
        "setRemoteKey":         "<topic for publishing remote key actions (optional)>"
    },

        {
            "name":     "<name for first input source>",
            "value":    "<MQTT value for first input source>"
        },
        {
            "name":     "<name for second input source>",
            "value":    "<MQTT value for second input source>"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "integerValue":     "<true to use 1|0 instead of true|false default onValue and offValue>",
    "onValue":          "<value representing on (optional)>",
    "offValue":         "<value representing off (optional)>",
}
```


## Temperature Sensor

Current temperature must be in the range 0 to 100 degrees Celsius to a maximum of 1dp.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "temperatureSensor",
    "name": "<name of sensor>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "caption": "<label (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {
        "getCurrentTemperature":        "<topic used to provide 'current temperature'>",
        "getStatusActive":              "<topic used to provide 'active' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusFault":               "<topic used to provide 'fault' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusTampered":            "<topic used to provide 'tampered' status (optional)>",
        "getStatusLowBattery":          "<topic used to provide 'low battery' status (optional)>"
    },
    "history": "<true to enable History service for Eve App (optional)>"
}
```


## Thermostat

Current heating/cooling state can be **OFF**, **HEAT** or **COOL**. Target heating/cooling state can be **OFF**, **HEAT**, **COOL** or **AUTO**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in `heatingCoolingStateValues`.

Temperature display units can be **CELSIUS** or **FAHRENHEIT**. To use different values, specify an array of strings in `temperatureDisplayUnitsValues`.

`minTemperature` and `maxTemperature` may optionally be used to change the minimum and maximum target temperatures that can be set from Homekit (defaulting to 10 and 38 respectively).

Configure `restrictHeatingCoolingState` to an array of integers to restrict the target heating/cooling states made available by Homekit, where 0 represents OFF, 1 HEAT, 2 COOL and 3 AUTO, for example:

   * `"restrictHeatingCoolingState": [0, 1, 2]` - for OFF, HEAT and COOL (but no AUTO)
   * `"restrictHeatingCoolingState": [0, 1]` - for OFF or HEAT only

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "thermostat",
    "name": "<name of device>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",
    "username": "<username for MQTT (optional)>",
    "password": "<password for MQTT (optional)>",
    "topics":
    {

    "maxTemperature": maximum_taret_temperature,
    "restrictHeatingCoolingState": "<array of allowed values - see notes above (optional)>"
}
```


## Valve

`valveType` can be `"sprinkler"`, `"shower"` or `"faucet"`.

If `durationTimer` is set to **true**, this plugin will provide additional characteristics to set the standard duration for the valve and will stop the water flow after this time.

If the device itself provides duration timing via MQTT or if you want to query or set the duration via MQTT, you can make use of `setDuration`/`getDuration`. The remaining time is shown in HomeKit even if no `getRemainingDuration` is configured. `getRemainingDuration` can be used to update the remaining time, if the duration is changed at the device itself in some way.

The default run time defaults to between 5 minutes and 1 hour (in 5 minute increments). This can be changed with `minDuration` and `maxDuration`. Note however that the Home App in iOS 12 doesn't like to show durations below 5 minutes. (This appears to have been improved in the iOS 13 Beta.)

Configuring `turnOffAfterms` causes the valve to turn off automatically the specified (fixed!) number of milliseconds after it is turned on by homekit. It can be used instead of `durationTimer` or `setDuration`/`getDuration`. 

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "valve",
    "valveType": "<valve type>",
    "name": "<name of valve>",
    "url": "<url of MQTT server (optional)>",

    "minDuration":      "<minimum duration (in seconds)>",
    "maxDuration":      "<maximum duration (in seconds)>"
}
```


## Weather Station

Current temperature must be in the range 0 to 100 degrees Celsius to a maximum of 1dp.

Current relative humidity must be in the range 0 to 100 percent with no decimal places.

Air Pressure must be in the range 700 to 1100 hPa.

*Air Pressure and the special weather characteristics (rain, wind, ...) are only supported in Eve-App*

Weather condition and wind direction are custom string values.

```javascript
{
    "accessory": "mqttthing",
    "type": "window",
    "name": "<name of device>",
    "topics":
